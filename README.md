# RNSignUpScreen

This is a technical test given to me following an interview. I gave myself a few hours to do it, so a lot of corner have had to be cut. Please keep that in mind during code review ðŸ˜‰.

## Demo

API calls are mocked:

-   The phone number **0600000000** will return a success.
-   The code **8888** will return a success.
